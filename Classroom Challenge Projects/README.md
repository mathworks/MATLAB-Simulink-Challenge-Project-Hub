# Welcome to the MATLAB and Simulink Classroom Challenge Projects Hub!
The Classroom Challenge Projects program offers a curated collection of real-world, MATLAB and Simulink–based projects designed to help early- stage college students build practical skills through hands-on problem solving. These projects are inspired by emerging industry needs and created to support learning pathways and introductory project- based experiences such as transfer bridge programs, introductory engineering courses, or summer research programs. These projects are designed to be completed by small groups of students over the course of several weeks. For more advanced projects, please explore the [MATLAB and Simulink Challenge Projects](https://github.com/mathworks/MATLAB-Simulink-Challenge-Project-Hub/tree/main).

Instructors are encouraged to use the resources and guidelines provided below to implement these projects, but you may choose to integrate the Classroom Challenge Projects into your classroom without participating in the program. In other words, you may use the available projects and resources at your discretion. Registration in the MathWorks Classroom Challenge Projects program provides your students with the opportunity to receive guidance on their projects from MathWorks engineers, receive a MathWorks-issued certificate of completion, and be eligible to receive prizes for an exceptional project solution. If you would like to register your class or program to participate in the MathWorks Classroom Challenge Projects program, see the guidelines in “How to Participate” below.

Educators and students can expect:
- Accessible, scaffolded projects that introduce authentic engineering and science applications while remaining approachable for learners with developing technical backgrounds
- Meaningful, industry relevant  challenges that help students build confidence with professional tools and workflows
- Ready-to- use faculty resources that support implementation, assessment, and classroom integration

## How to Participate
Below you will find a suggested timeline and set of instructor guidelines for implementing the MathWorks Classroom Challenge Projects in your class or program. For each step, you will find a list of related resources in the rightmost column to help you with each implementation milestone.

Please Note: To participate in the MathWorks Classroom Challenge Projects program, you **must register** your class or program before project work begins **and submit** student names for certificates of completion after you have evaluated all student submissions. *All other elements in the instructor guidelines below are suggestions only*, based on what has worked well in other classrooms. You may choose to integrate these projects into your program or class at your discretion.

|**STEP 3: Project preparation**|
|<ul><li>Follow the [instructions](#discussion-board) to create a discussion board for your classroom or program for students to collaborate and ask questions (this board will be periodically monitored by MathWorks staff)</li><li>Assign students to teams (if using teams) and encourage teams to sign a [teamwork agreement](https://github.com/mathworks/MATLAB-Simulink-Challenge-Project-Hub/blob/main/Classroom%20Challenge%20Projects/Faculty%20Resources/Teamwork%20Agreement%20Template.docx) (if needed). This teamwork agreement is *optional and for student use only*, not to be submitted to MathWorks.</li><li>Review the [Generative AI Guidelines](#generative-ai-guidelines) with your students</li></ul>|~1 week before project work begins|<ul><li>[Instructions](#discussion-board) to create a discussion board</li><li>[Example teamwork agreement](https://github.com/mathworks/MATLAB-Simulink-Challenge-Project-Hub/blob/main/Classroom%20Challenge%20Projects/Faculty%20Resources/Teamwork%20Agreement%20Template.docx)</li><li>[Generative AI Guidelines](#generative-ai-guidelines)</li></ul>|
|**STEP 4: Project work**|
|<ul><li>Ensure that students make progress on project work according to task milestones within each project</li><li>Monitor your classroom or program discussion board</li></ul>|Main phase of project work (~2-4 weeks)|<ul><li>Each project page contains a list of student tasks toward project completion (see example [here](https://github.com/mathworks/MATLAB-Simulink-Challenge-Project-Hub/tree/main/Classroom%20Challenge%20Projects/Projects/Maximizing%20Solar%20Panel%20Output%20for%20a%20Fixed%20Area#suggested-steps)). Depending on the length of your class or program, you may consider setting certain tasks as milestones to ensure steady progress</li></ul>|
|**STEP 5: Project evaluation**|
|<ul><li>Evaluate student project submissions. You may nominate 1-3 exception project submissions for MathWorks review and prize. All other teams will receive a certificate of completion.
