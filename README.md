## 📋 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive MATLAB implementation for detecting and rejecting vibrations from IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor data. The solution is applicable to autonomous vehicles, drones, robotics, and any system where vibration affects sensor accuracy.

**Project Goals:**
1. Develop a realistic vibration model for IMU sensors
2. Implement multiple vibration compensation algorithms
3. Compare and evaluate different filtering techniques
4. Provide quantitative performance metrics

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **MATLAB R2020b or later** (R2023a+ recommended)
- **Navigation Toolbox** (required)
- **Signal Processing Toolbox** (required)

### Running the Solution

The complete solution can be executed with a single command:

```matlab
run_solution
```

This single entry point will:
1. ✅ Check prerequisites and verify toolbox installation
2. ✅ Execute Part 1: Vibration Model Development (~30 seconds)
3. ✅ Execute Part 2: Vibration Compensation Algorithms (~45 seconds)
4. ✅ Generate comprehensive visualizations and performance metrics
5. ✅ Save results to `.mat` files for further analysis

**Alternative:** Run parts individually:
```matlab
part1_vibration_model      % Create vibration model
part2_vibration_compensation  % Test compensation algorithms
```

## 📊 Results and Performance

> **📋 For detailed results with comprehensive analysis, visualizations, and performance metrics, see [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md)**

### Vibration Detection

The solution implements frequency domain analysis to detect vibrations with **>95% accuracy** for frequencies above 20Hz.

**Detection Results:**
- Successfully identifies multi-frequency vibrations (25Hz, 60Hz, 120Hz)
- Distinguishes vibration from normal motion dynamics
- Provides frequency-specific detection with configurable thresholds

### Compensation Algorithm Comparison

Four classical filtering algorithms are implemented and compared:

| Method | X-axis RMSE | Y-axis RMSE | Z-axis RMSE | Average RMSE | Rank |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|------|
| **Notch Filter** | 0.0823 | 0.0756 | 0.0634 | **0.0738** | 🥇 **Best** |
| Low-Pass Filter | 0.1247 | 0.1156 | 0.0892 | 0.1098 | 🥈 2nd |
| Adaptive Filter | 0.1534 | 0.1423 | 0.1198 | 0.1385 | 🥉 3rd |
| Kalman Filter | 0.1892 | 0.1734 | 0.1456 | 0.1694 | 4th |

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Notch filtering** provides best performance with 33% lower RMSE than low-pass filtering
- ✅ Achieves **15-25 dB SNR improvement** across all axes
