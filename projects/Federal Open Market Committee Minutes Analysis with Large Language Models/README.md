## Motivation

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the monetary policymaking body of the Federal Reserve System, the central bank of the United States. The Committee holds eight regularly scheduled meetings each year, with additional meetings convened as needed. For various participants in the financial markets, analyzing the FOMC minutes is crucial, as they provide deeper and more nuanced insights into monetary policy decisions. Economists use the minutes to refine their economic models and interest rate projections by incorporating the Fed’s latest views and forecasts. Investors rely on them to anticipate market volatility across assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities.

## Project Description

Work with the [Database Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/datafeed.html), [Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html) and [Deep Learning Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html) products to retrieve the [FOMC meeting minutes](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), convert the text data into numeric representations and store them in vector database. Raise related questions and utilize the LLMs to generate answers.

Suggested steps:
1.	Become familiar with the MATLAB based statistics and machine learning toolbox, database toolbox, text analytics examples listed in Background Material section below.
2.	Retrieve the current and historical FOMC files from the website of Federal Reserve System
3.	Preprocess the text data and convert them into numeric representations
4.	Create a database in Postgres and store the cleaned vectors into the database
5.	Generate prompts and compute the similarities between the stored vectors
6.	Use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the answers based on the computed similarities

Project variations:
1.	LLMs access with API keys

Advanced project work:
1.	Create an interactive app, ensuring it aligns with the established project workflow
2.	Develop a validation framework for assessing the accuracy of responses generated by LLMs
3.	Integrate diverse data sources, including SEC filings, real-time market data, financial news outlets, and social media platforms, to enrich analysis and insights.
