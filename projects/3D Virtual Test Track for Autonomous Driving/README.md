## Motivation

Autonomous driving will revolutionize transportation and change the way we move around and receive goods and services. Designing a safe and reliable autonomous vehicle is one of the hardest problems that humans have ever tackled. Simulation is critical to the development of such systems, but there are few open scene datasets. By developing a 3D virtual test track available to researchers worldwide you will help accelerate the development of autonomous vehicles.

## Project Description

Test tracks such as [Mcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mcity) and [K-City](https://www.imnovation-hub.com/digital-transformation/k-cit-test-bed-fo-driverless-cars/) are used to test physical prototypes for autonomous vehicles. Virtual test tracks can be used at an earlier stage to explore ideas and test algorithms for autonomous driving. RoadRunner is the leading product for building automated driving scenes. Do a literature search to find the common challenging scenarios for autonomous driving and use RoadRunner to build a test track that has the key elements. Export your work into industry-standard formats such as [OpenDRIVE](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive/) and [FBX](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fbx/overview). 

Attributes of such a dataset might include: 

- Both highway and urban road elements 

- Range of road grades, banking, and curvatures 

- Traffic control infrastructure (signals, signage, street markings) 

- Occlusions (buildings, signposts, trees, parked vehicles) 

- Complex junctions (offset, oblique, 5+ legs, roundabouts, merges and splits) 

- Restricted lane types (bus only, bike only, gore points) 

- Pedestrian-road interfaces (crosswalks, sidewalks, “pedestrian scramble”) 

- Sensor challenges (weathered lane markings, occluded signage, overpasses, foliage) 

- Unprotected turns 


Advanced features:

- Adapt your scene to create variants incorporating the signs and road markings of different countries 

- Add different pavement types and on-road elements including speed bumps and traffic control objects (cones, barriers, etc.) 

- Edit your scene to create a version suitable for left-hand traffic
