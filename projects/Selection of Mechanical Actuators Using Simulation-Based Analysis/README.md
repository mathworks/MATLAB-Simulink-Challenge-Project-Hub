## Motivation

Changing to novel actuation systems and/or system electrification often requires major redesign of a product. System-level simulation analysis using tools like Simscape&trade; and Simulink&reg; is being used in many industries to manage deployment of these disruptive technologies. In this project you will develop analytical and simulation-based methods to help product designers make good and informed actuation choices. Through this you will develop skills that are of interest to multiple industries.

## Project Description

In this project you will explore the behaviors of different types of actuation. To provide a rigorous framework within which to compare actuation technologies, it is suggested that you make use of the property charts proposed by Huber, Fleck and Ashby [1]. You may want to focus on a subset of the available actuation technologies – for example you could compare different types of rotary electric motors, or compare all types of linear actuators (electric, hydraulic, pneumatic and variants thereof).


When comparing technologies, you will find that some properties require simulation-based analysis. For the latter, The MathWorks Simscape&trade; product family already includes example models of many common actuation technologies. You will probably also need to build some of your own models, possibly also creating custom Simscape blocks to represent novel actuation solutions. Something to consider is combination of two different actuator types to make up for inherent deficiencies in each. For example, take a look at the Hybrid Linear Actuator example in Simscape Electrical&trade;. 


The outcome of this project could be an analysis of two or more actuation technologies with results presented using the property charts proposed in [1]. The analysis should be presented as a short write-up with supporting Simulink/Simscape and associated MATLAB scripts used to produce the results. A good solution will be written in a way that enables others to build on your work by adding information for other actuation technologies.


This project could take many different directions, but by way of example, here are some suggested steps:

1.	Read and familiarize yourself with the Huber, Fleck and Ashby paper.
2.	Think about what other property charts a product designer might find useful – is the list in the Huber paper complete?
3.	Add the Hybrid Linear Actuator example actuation to the property charts. In what applications might this hybrid actuator be useful?
4.	Come up with two or more other hybrid actuation ideas, developing supporting models in Simscape. Use these to add these hybrid actuation solutions to the property charts.
5.	Write more generalized MATLAB scripts that can be used to automatically extract property charts from any Simscape actuator model.
6.	Using MATLAB develop a solution that maps from an actuation requirement to a set of suitable technologies using data from the Huber paper and from your analysis of hybrid solutions.


Depending on how much time you have for your project, you might want to pick a subset of these steps.
