SUMMARY - Part 2: Vibration Compensation
========================================
â€¢ Implemented vibration detection using frequency domain analysis
â€¢ Developed and compared 4 compensation algorithms:
  1. Low-Pass Filtering (removes high-freq vibration)
  2. Notch Filtering (targets specific frequencies)
  3. Adaptive Filtering (adjusts to local conditions)
  4. Kalman Filtering (optimal estimation approach)
â€¢ Best method: Notch with 0.0738 m/sÂ² average RMSE
â€¢ Successfully demonstrated vibration detection and compensation

Practical Recommendations:
â€¢ Use notch filters when vibration frequencies are known and stable
â€¢ Use low-pass filters for general high-frequency vibration suppression
â€¢ Use adaptive methods when vibration characteristics vary over time
â€¢ Use Kalman filters when system dynamics are well understood
â€¢ Consider hybrid approaches combining multiple techniques
