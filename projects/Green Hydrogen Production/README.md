## Motivation

In the U.S., the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation, electricity generation and industrial processes. Green hydrogen is produced from the electrolysis of water, powered by renewable energy sources, and is being considered as a pathway to decarbonize energy dense sectors such as aviation, and industrial manufacturing. Most hydrogen produced today is from reforming of natural gas, but this method releases greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. A key challenge is how to produce green hydrogen economically and in a repeatable way, given the variable nature of renewable energy and the need to also provide electricity to the grid.

## Project Description

You will develop a reversible fuel-cell model using [Simscape™]( https://www.mathworks.com/products/simscape.html), which has the ability to act as an electricity generator or electrolyzer. You will integrate this model into a renewable-energy microgrid structure and explore various operational profiles and system configurations that permit a thorough evaluation of energy and sizing requirements to meet certain hydrogen production goals. You will use the models to provide informed, data-driven comparisons and recommendations as to the most promising configurations and supporting technologies. 

Suggested steps:
1. Become familiar with existing models (links below) and use these as the basis for your project – in particular, build the model out to be a three-phase representation and integrate solar power and energy storage. 
2. Create a reversible fuel-cell model using the Simscape Language and integrate into the model developed in 1. 

Project variations: 
1. Build models of different fidelity levels, in order to evaluate scenarios ranging from longer-term system response over days or weeks to short-term behavior over micro-seconds to seconds to evaluate the impact of power electronic switching through to thermal response. 
2. Calculate expected efficiency and power requirements for a number of operational scenarios. 
3. Write up data-drive recommendations to influence each of:
	1. Industry – should the technology you investigated be further developed and why?
	2. Government – shape government policy to direct investment and leverage the benefits of clean technologies.
