## Motivation

New 5G and IoT systems are driving the deployment of dense small cell networks and leading the way to the smart cities of tomorrow.
Companies need to use signal coverage maps to optimize and validate their networks but collecting signal measurements to generate those maps is an expensive process.
To reduce cost there is a need to apply prediction models to generate coverage maps from limited, sparse measurement data.

## Projects Description

Use MATLAB® and toolboxes to implement, explore, and compare different techniques for predicting signal coverage from real signal measurements. Develop propagation models from the measurements data and use them to generate coverage maps for new scenarios.

Suggested steps:

1.	Locate signal strength measurement data sets. One portal of wireless data which may help is [CRAWDAD](https://crawdad.org/keyword-signal-strength.html). An example data set is available from [mySignals](http://www.mysignals.gr/research.php).
2.	Research data-driven techniques used to predict coverage maps from signal strength measurements. In particular, study [City-Wide Signal Strength Maps: Prediction with Random Forests](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3308558.3313726).
3.	Design and implement data-driven propagation models in MATLAB using the measurements data. Using the paper mentioned above as a guide, implement one model as a baseline using geospatial interpolation techniques, and implement another model using machine learning techniques such as random forests.
4.	Generate coverage maps using your propagation models and compare your results against theoretical propagation models which are available in Communications Toolbox.
