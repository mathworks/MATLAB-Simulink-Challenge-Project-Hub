## Motivation

Boston Dynamics and MIT Biomimetics Robotics Lab have led the revolution in legged robots.
Quadruped robots can walk over terrains difficult for their wheeled counterparts performing a diverse set of tasks.
Moreover, legged robots have the capability to change the body position and posture without changing the foot points.
Thus, they have captured interest from a wide range of industries--military scout, street patrol, factory inspection, and even home butler. 
Robot manipulators with the locomotion ability provided by legged robots enable robot arms to work in a much larger variety of fields including construction, agriculture, and forestry.
Get prepared for the industry behind this blooming application! 


## Project Description

Create a Simulink® model of a quadruped robot with a manipulator. Design control algorithms for it to do the following tasks: 
- Scan its 360-degree surrounding
- Going upstairs
- Holding a cup of water while going upstairs
- One more fun task you define

Suggested high-level steps:

1. Use CAD software to model the robot and import it to Simscape™
2. Add sensors and motors to the Simscape model, so you can command the movements of the robot and measure the motion of every link of the robot
3. Define a controller in Simulink to perform individual tasks
4. Use Stateflow® to connect a sequence of tasks together.
