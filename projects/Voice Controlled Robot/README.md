## Motivation

AI-powered virtual assistants can buy us dinner while a robotic vacuum cleans our home as we seat on the couch talking to our smart TV.
Clearly, our lives are changing and adapting to the omnipresence of these devices. 
The need to interact with such devices, not only at home but also at work and even on the streets, has made ‘human-robot interaction’ a crucial and rapidly increasing field. 
Get prepared to this new trend and for a career in this field by acquiring the skills to build a voiced controlled robot.


## Project Description

Design and program a wheeled robot to respond to voice commands, visually identify specified targets, and navigate around obstacles to reach the target.
Use a low-cost platform such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi to build the robot and design the system including robot mission, control, and perception using Simulink.
Eventually deploy the designed system to the robot.

Suggested steps:

1.	Use MATLAB or Simulink to establish a framework of the vision-guided robot, and make sure if you hand code a target, the robot will search for the target visually, and go there.
2.	Add voice input, pass it through voice categorizer to the robot planner (you can either do it by defining specific features in the sound signal, or do it the deep learning way, find an example [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/audio/ug/Speech-Command-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning.html#d123e9007))
3.	At minimum, you should have “return”, “turn left”, “turn right”, “red target”, “blue target”; as voice commands
4.	Connect the whole system and play with it.
